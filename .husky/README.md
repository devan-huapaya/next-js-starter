# Husky

(Husky)[https://github.com/typicode/husky] is a task runner that does a lot of things. In this
project we are using it to call lint-staged on pre-commit.

(Lint-staged)[https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged] runs eslint and prettier on code that has been
changed before it is committed to the code base. See "lint-staged" in the [package.json](../package.json) file.
